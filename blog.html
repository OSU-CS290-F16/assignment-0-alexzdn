		<td>This assignment was easy for me because I had some experience with HTML.
		When I sat down to do it, I got curious how to add background image with css,
		such that image will fill the whole page no matter what size is the window.
		I used <b>background-size</b> property with value <b>cover</b>. I also added
		JavaScript button to access my blog page, just to see how it works. I was able to 
		find the answers to my questions at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a>.</td>
